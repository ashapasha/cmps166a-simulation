Game Theory and Applications (CMPS/TIM/ECON 166A) project, Fall 2016

Files:
    tree.py -
        defines tree class, viable moves, and equations that determine its responses and shifting satisfaction
    fungus.py -
        defines fungus class, viable moves, and equations that determine its responses and shifting satisfaction
    externalconditions.py -
        defines artificial climate/environment changes that impact output of each party/satisfaction levels.
        Occurs based on an rng, more can be added.
    runsimulation.py -
        runs each set of equations until they produce the same contribution (output) 20 times in a row, demonstrating
        stability. this number can be changed at will!
